It also depends of the OS being used. To avoid dealing with these issues, we will simply move on to executing scripts instead of notebooks\n",

    "\n",
    "We are going to start by defining the skills we'd like to give our Agents. Skills are python functions that must be defined with a **docstring**. A **docstring** is a rigorous way to comment and document functions. \n",
    "\n",
    "### Docstrings\n",
    "\n",
    "Docstrings in Python are special strings that serve as comments for different aspects of a Python program. They are used to document Python modules, functions, classes, and methods.\n",
    "\n",
    "Hereâ€™s an example of how you might use a docstring:\n",
    "```python\n",
    "def add_numbers(a, b):\n",
    "    \"\"\"\n",
    "    This function adds two numbers and returns the result.\n",
    "\n",
    "    Parameters:\n",
    "    a (int): The first number to add.\n",
    "    b (int): The second number to add.\n",
    "\n",
    "    Returns:\n",
    "    int: The sum of a and b.\n",
    "    \"\"\"\n",
    "    return a + b\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Here, the docstring is enclosed in triple quotes and provides a brief description of the function, its parameters, and its return value. This information can later be accessed using the help() function attribute in Python, which can be very useful for understanding how to use the function properly. Docstrings are how our agents will know how to use and what each function is for.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Get stock prices\n",
